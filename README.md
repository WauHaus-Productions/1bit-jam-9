# 1 bit Jam

## Exporting
Download the export templates by clickgin on `Editor > Gestusci modelli di esportazione`, and download for the best mirror. it will be a 1GB download.

The export presets are tracked in a specific file that is tracked in version control.
For exporting, you need the path of yout godot executable. for me is "C:\Users\Oscar\Desktop\godot\Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64_console.exe".

Once you do this, to perform an export you just need to call `export.bat <path-of-godot>` with the correct path to your godot binary.
it will create in `build/unzipped` the unzipped version of the game (you can serve it with a python http server), and then a `build/game.zip` that you will have to upload on itch.
