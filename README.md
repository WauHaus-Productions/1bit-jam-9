## Exporting
Download the export templates by clickgin on `Editor > Gestusci modelli di esportazione`, and download for the best mirror. it will be a 1GB download.

The export presets are tracked in a specific file that is tracked in version control.
For exporting, you need the path of yout godot executable. for me is "C:\Users\Oscar\Desktop\godot\Godot_v4.6.1-stable_win64_console.exe".
